# Appendix: Glossary of Terms

**CTF**
Compact C Type Format. Assists in debugging. See
[ctf(5)](http://illumos.org/man/4/ctf).

**CW**
Compiler wrapper. Historical version of illumos were built with Sun Studio
(see below). In order to transition to the `gcc` compiler, the compiler
wrapper was developed to translate compiler flags from Sun Studio syntax
to GCC syntax.

**FMA**

**Gate; illumos gate**
Gate is old Sun Microsystems terminology for a software source-code repository.

**Lint; linting**
Using the `smatch` tool to check for common programming errors.

**ON**
OS/Net (Operating system/Network) consolidation. In historical version of SunOS,
OS and Net were separate software components. Now this term refers to the
operating system as a whole. 

**RTI**
Request to Integrate. The final approval process needed for a change to become
part of the illumos gate. See [Integrating Changes](./integrating.html).

**Sun Studio**
A compiler suite historically required to build illumos. As of 2016, dependency
on Sun Studio has been eliminated and the use of its old `lint` tool was
replaced with smatch.

**UTS**
Unix Time Sharing. This is a historical name for UNIX, and lives on in the
source tree as the `uts/` directory, which houses the kernel.
