**CW**

wrapper was developed to translate compiler flags from Sun Studio formatted
`Makefile`s to `gcc` style compiler flags.

Gate is old Sun Microsystems terminology for a software source-code repository.

**Lint; linting**
Using the `lint` tool to check for common programming errors.

OS and Net were separate software components. Now this term refers to the
operating system as a whole. 

**RTI**
Request to Integrate. The final approval process needed for a change to become
part of the illumos gate. See [Integrating Changes](./integrating.html)

**Sun Studio**
A compiler suite historically required to build illumos. As of 2016, dependency
on Sun Studio has been eliminated with the exception of the `lint` tool.

**UTS**
Unix Time Sharing. This is a historical name for UNIX, and lives on in the
source tree as the `uts/` directory, which houses the kernel.
